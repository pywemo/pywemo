"""Script to generate .py files from .xsd using generateDS.

generateDS is used to auto-generate the necessary python modules to support
the UPnP device and service specifications. The purpose of this script is
mainly to document the local changes made after running generateDS. Putting
the local changes in this script makes the builds repeatable and hopefully
allows for easier upgrading to future versions of generateDS.
