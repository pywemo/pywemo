"""Methods to make changes to the long press rules for a device.

Wemo devices store a database of rules that configure actions for the device. A
long press rule is activated when the button on the device is pressed for 2
seconds. A person can press the button for 2 seconds and, based on the rules
configured for the device, it will turn on/off/toggle other Wemo devices on the
network. The methods in this mixin allow editing of the devices that are
controlled by a long press.
